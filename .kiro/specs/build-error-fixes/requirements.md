# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical build errors preventing the application from compiling successfully. The build process is failing due to missing imports, incorrect Storybook configurations, React Hook violations, and various TypeScript/ESLint issues that need to be resolved to restore the application to a buildable state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully without errors, so that I can deploy and run the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL complete without any compilation errors
2. WHEN the build process encounters missing imports THEN the system SHALL have all required components properly imported
3. WHEN Storybook files are processed THEN the system SHALL use the correct framework packages instead of renderer packages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React components to follow proper Hook usage patterns, so that the application runs without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React Hooks are used THEN the system SHALL ensure they are called only in function components or custom hooks
2. WHEN useEffect hooks are defined THEN the system SHALL include all required dependencies in dependency arrays
3. WHEN conditional rendering is used THEN the system SHALL not call hooks conditionally

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want JSX content to be properly escaped, so that the application renders correctly without HTML entity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX contains quotes THEN the system SHALL properly escape them using HTML entities
2. WHEN JSX contains apostrophes THEN the system SHALL properly escape them using HTML entities
3. WHEN JSX content is rendered THEN the system SHALL display text correctly without unescaped characters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript and ESLint warnings to be minimized, so that the codebase maintains high quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables are declared THEN the system SHALL use them or remove unused declarations
2. WHEN `any` types are used THEN the system SHALL replace them with proper type definitions where possible
3. WHEN imports are declared THEN the system SHALL use proper import syntax and remove unused imports
