# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive, modular dashboard UI system for the Cubcen AI Agent Management Platform. The system provides a reusable, responsive dashboard framework with advanced data visualization capabilities, comprehensive theming, and full accessibility compliance. This goes beyond basic page functionality to create a sophisticated dashboard infrastructure that can be used across the entire platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular DashboardLayout component with CSS Grid, so that I can create consistent, responsive dashboard layouts across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer uses the DashboardLayout component THEN the system SHALL provide a CSS Grid layout with header, navigation sidebar, main content, and footer regions
2. WHEN the screen width is less than 768px THEN the system SHALL collapse the grid into a single-column mobile layout
3. WHEN the navigation sidebar is collapsed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and content flow
4. WHEN the layout is rendered THEN the system SHALL support customizable grid areas and responsive breakpoints
5. WHEN the layout contains nested components THEN the system SHALL maintain proper z-index stacking and overflow handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable Card components with comprehensive props, so that I can create consistent data displays with charts, metrics, and interactive content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a Card component THEN the system SHALL support props for title, metric value, unit, icon, and children content
2. WHEN cards are arranged in the main section THEN the system SHALL use a 12-column grid system with responsive breakpoints (3 cards per row on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
3. WHEN cards contain charts or data visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide a ChartWrapper component for consistent styling
4. WHEN cards are prioritized THEN the system SHALL place critical KPI cards in the top-left position
5. WHEN cards have interactive elements THEN the system SHALL support click handlers and state management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a designer, I want a comprehensive theming system with CSS variables, so that I can maintain consistent visual design and support multiple themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theming system is implemented THEN the system SHALL define CSS variables for primary, secondary, accent, background, and text colors
2. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure all text meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (â‰¥4.5:1 ratio)
3. WHEN typography is applied THEN the system SHALL implement a consistent scale: H1 32px bold, H2 24px semibold, body 16px normal, labels 14px
4. WHEN themes are switched THEN the system SHALL update all components without requiring page refresh
5. WHEN custom themes are created THEN the system SHALL validate color contrast and accessibility requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want integrated data visualization components, so that I can display complex data through interactive charts and graphs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chart library is integrated THEN the system SHALL support line, bar, pie, and heatmap chart types
2. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults for colors, legends, tooltips, and axis labels
3. WHEN chart data is updated THEN the system SHALL animate transitions smoothly and maintain performance
4. WHEN charts are customized THEN the system SHALL support prop-based configuration for all visual elements
5. WHEN charts are exported THEN the system SHALL provide download functionality in multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive filtering and accessibility features, so that I can efficiently navigate and interact with dashboard data using any input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on chart elements THEN the system SHALL filter data across all connected dashboard cards
2. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide proper tabindex, focus styles, and ARIA roles for all interactive elements
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL announce data updates and provide descriptive labels
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain filter state across component re-renders
5. WHEN accessibility features are tested THEN the system SHALL pass automated accessibility audits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want responsive design and touch-optimized interactions, so that I can effectively use the dashboard on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is viewed on small screens THEN the system SHALL stack cards vertically and optimize spacing
2. WHEN users interact on touch devices THEN the system SHALL replace hover tooltips with tap-based tooltips
3. WHEN mobile navigation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a bottom navigation bar for key sections
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts smoothly without content jumping
5. WHEN touch gestures are used THEN the system SHALL support swipe navigation and pinch-to-zoom for charts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want optimized loading and rendering, so that the dashboard maintains excellent performance even with complex data visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN heavy chart components are loaded THEN the system SHALL use dynamic imports for lazy loading
2. WHEN components re-render THEN the system SHALL memoize pure components to prevent unnecessary updates
3. WHEN large datasets are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization for lists and tables
4. WHEN the dashboard initializes THEN the system SHALL show progressive loading states and skeleton screens
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve Core Web Vitals scores in the "Good" range

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing and documentation, so that the dashboard system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are written THEN the system SHALL include tests for layout, card rendering, and chart integration
2. WHEN Storybook stories are created THEN the system SHALL demonstrate each Card variant and responsive breakpoint
3. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL document CSS variables, component APIs, and accessibility features
4. WHEN TypeScript interfaces are defined THEN the system SHALL provide strict typing for all component props
5. WHEN the testing suite runs THEN the system SHALL maintain 90% code coverage and pass all accessibility tests
